# OpenMC Setup for dummies 
To set up OpenMC, download the `openmc-setup.sh` script and place it in a convenient directory where you want the code installed (along with cross-section libraries). Then execute the following two commands, 
````
 $ chmod +x openmc-setup.sh
 $ ./openmc-setup.sh
 ````
 Done!
